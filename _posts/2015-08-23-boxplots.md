title: Compare distributions with box plots, not bar plots
categories: notes
---

In many scientific journals, authors use bar plots to compare two or more
distributions. Often, the error bar is only present for the upper limit and
not for the lower limit. Sometimes, the bar for the control group has no error
bars due to data normalization. Here, I simulate a small experiment to
illustrate why this normalization is problematic and why box plots are better
than bar plots for comparing two distributions.

# Simulation

Let's simulate a simple experiment where the control samples have a value
centered around 1 and the experimental samples have a value centered around 2.
We might imagine that these values represent gene expression or some other
measure of interest.




{% highlight r %}
# Set the random seed to reproduce the random numbers.
set.seed(6)

# Some technical variation is shared by control and experimental groups.
n <- 5
shared_variation <- rnorm(n, mean = 1, sd = 0.5)
dat <- melt(data.frame(
  # The value for controls is centered around 1.
  Control = rnorm(n, mean = 1, sd = 0.25) * shared_variation,
  # The value for experimental samples is centered around 2.
  Experiment = rnorm(n, mean = 2, sd = 0.25) * shared_variation,
  ID = 1:n
), id.vars = 'ID')
{% endhighlight %}


| ID|variable   |     value|
|--:|:----------|---------:|
|  1|Control    | 1.2392120|
|  2|Control    | 0.4608037|
|  3|Control    | 1.6991868|
|  4|Control    | 1.8845041|
|  5|Control    | 0.7468247|
|  1|Experiment | 2.7597986|
|  2|Experiment | 1.1681772|

# t-test

With normal distributions, we can use the t-test to compare the distribution
of values from the control group and the experimental group. This helps us to
determine if the difference between the two distributions is statistically
significant.


{% highlight r %}
# Test if the distribution of control values differs from experimental values.
t1 <- t.test(
  x = dat$value[dat$variable == "Control"],
  y = dat$value[dat$variable == "Experiment"]
)
{% endhighlight %}


| estimate| estimate1| estimate2| statistic|   p.value| parameter|  conf.low|  conf.high|
|--------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|----------:|
| -1.28566|  1.206106|  2.491766| -2.525504| 0.0407433|  6.739684| -2.498911| -0.0724094|

After normalizing the data so that the controls are to equal 1.0, we no longer
test for a difference between control and experimental distributions. Instead,
we now test if the experimental distribution is different from 1.0:


{% highlight r %}
# Normalize Controls to 1.0.
dat2 <- unsplit(lapply(split.data.frame(dat, dat$ID), function(x) {
  x$value <- x$value / x$value[1]
  x
}), dat$ID)

# Test if the experimental distribution differs from 1.0.
t2 <- t.test(
  x = dat2$value[dat2$variable == "Control"],
  y = dat2$value[dat2$variable == "Experiment"]
)
{% endhighlight %}


|  estimate| estimate1| estimate2| statistic|   p.value| parameter|  conf.low|  conf.high|
|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|----------:|
| -1.196441|         1|  2.196441| -8.018042| 0.0013126|         4| -1.610738| -0.7821436|

In this second test, the mean value for the control samples is
1 instead of 1.2. We can see that
the t-statistic -8 is inflated relative to the correct
value of -2.5 and the p-value is lower than it should
be.

# Bar Plots

Journals often publish bar plot figures that do not clearly communicate the
results to the reader:

- The data is displayed as a bar plot of mean or median values.
- The lower bounds of error bars are omitted.
- Legends do not explain the meaning of the bars or error bars.

Below, I show the data represented as bars of mean values with error bars of
standard deviations.


{% highlight r %}
plot_bars <- function(dat, ttest) {
  # mean by group
  x <- by(dat$value, dat$variable, mean)
  x <- melt(as.data.frame(as.list(x)), id.vars = NULL)
  
  # sd by group
  x$sd <- as.vector(by(dat$value, dat$variable, sd))
  
  ggplot(x, aes(x = variable, y = value, group = variable)) +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymax = value + sd, ymin = value - sd), width = .1) +
    geom_bar(aes(variable, value),
             stat = "identity", fill = "white", color = "black") +
    theme_bw(base_size = 18) +
    labs(x = "", y = "", title = paste("P = ", format.pval(ttest$p.value, 2)))
}

grid.arrange(plot_bars(dat, t1), plot_bars(dat2, t2), nrow = 1)
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that the figure on the right might appear to show that there is a very
significant difference between the experimental and control groups.

Normalizing the data so that the controls are equal to 1.0 causes two effects:

- The technical variation between experiments is hidden. 
- The difference between the control and the experimental groups is
  exaggerated. This is because we're comparing the experimental distribution
  to 1.0 instead comparing it to the control distribution.

# Box Plots

A box plot is a good way to compare two or more distributions. Here's the
anatomy of a boxplot created with [ggplot2]:

I would like to see data presented with box plots as shown below instead of
bar plots. I think the scientific question, "Are the distributions different
from each other?", comes naturally from this kind of presentation.


{% highlight r %}
# Show a box plot of the data.
p1 <- ggplot(dat) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = variable, y = value)) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 18) +
  labs(x = "", y = "", title = paste("P = ", format.pval(t1$p.value, 2)))

p2 <- ggplot(dat2) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = variable, y = value)) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 18) +
  labs(x = "", y = "", title = paste("P = ", format.pval(t2$p.value, 2)))

grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
{% endhighlight %}

On the left, notice that the range of values in the control group overlaps
with the range of values in the experimental group. The variation in the
control group tells us something about the amount of technical variation
between repeated experiments. If the technical variation is too high, we might
have some reason to be skeptical about the reproducibility of the assay.

On the right, we hide the variation between control samples, so we can make no
assessment of the technical variation in the experiment. This point is more
obvious for the box plot than it is for the bar plot above.
