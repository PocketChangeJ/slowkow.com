I prepared some files that you might find useful. Several members of my group
use them. I'd be happy to hear what you do with my files. Please contact me if
you have any questions.

1. [Allele frequencies for each population (AFR, AMR, ASN, EUR)][freq]

2. [Linkage disequilibrium (LD) calculations for each population][pairwise_ld]

3. [LD intervals for each population][ld_intervals]

[freq]: https://data.broadinstitute.org/srlab/BEAGLE/1kG-beagle-release3/freq/
[pairwise_ld]: https://data.broadinstitute.org/srlab/BEAGLE/1kG-beagle-release3/pairwise_ld/r2_ge_0.8/
